# gpgate/tools

In this folder you find some tools which I think are helpful to deploy your gpgate controller.

- **rf_decode** is adapted from the rc-switch examples. It allows to listen for RF signals, useful if you don't know the bitstream to use for your gates!
- **waypoints** a sketch to use your GPS module to gather your coordinates to use as waypoints
- **gates** once you have the bitstreams of your gates you might want to test if the remote works before deploying gpgate
- **make** a Python script to generate your `mygate.h` file
